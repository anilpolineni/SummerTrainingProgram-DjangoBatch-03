==>static files handling:
    ------------------------------
    ==> we have to create a static folder inside our app
    -- in that static folder we will store css,js and image files
    --> foraccessing those static files we have define
        STATIC_URL = 'static' in settings.py
    --. for loading this static file we have to define a statement inside
        templates(.html)
                {% load static %}

==> bootsrap in Dajngo:
    ..1)bootstrap.mon.css
    ..2)jquery.min.js
    ..3)bootstrap.min.js

    --> we have to mention links  direclty in style tag
    --> second way is we have to download bootstrap files from respective source then place all those files inside static folder
